# Calculator App

Very simple app made as one of tasks for the freeCodeCamp certification.

## Tech Stack

- Pure React (create-react-app).
- Bootstrap.

### What I learned

While the task required me to use some kind of framework (React), I realized that the only justification of using framework here was an ability to rerender "display" component by useState() method.

Otherwise, there was zero to none viability to split the code in modules, etc.

However, the best part was actually writing a logic for this calculator to react appropriately on each button press.
